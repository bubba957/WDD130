      <h1>
        My Spring Creek Event Website. I got the idea for this website from my old town of Spring Creek. It is not a very big town and so I feel like a simple web page will be enough. Keeping in mind to not make it so simple that my website will barely get any visitors. For my three pages of the website, I feel like it needs one page entirely devoted to this one activity which may either be a Trunk or Treat or a New Year’s Fireworks Show. And yes, it does seem like I will have to work on that name to be ready for my actual website. As I said in the proposal, it is going to be for all ages; whether you are young or old, fat or skinny, nerdy or brawny, it does not matter. As long as you are a member of my fictional town of Spring Creek you can attend any of these events. The reason why they will come is to find out events that are happening in the area. That is the reason why it is going to have a myriad of events to cover the whole year. Right now, I have thought of four events – the afore mentioned Halloween Trunk or Treat, the New Year’s Fireworks Show, there is going to be a 50’s Dance, and finally an Outing at the Park held on or close to Thanksgiving. But I am thinking that I may have to come up with more events than just those four if I really want to make my website an actual one you could see on the web. Maybe I will get some ideas from different event websites. All I am certain of for right now is that my website will be the place to go if you are looking for something to do in the made-up town of Spring Creek. I will also have to design my website as if there is already or may just be another website like the one I will be building. I really do not know if a website like that will exist so I will have to cover all of my bases if I really want to get it up and running.

      <h3>Halloween: Trunk or Treat</h3>
      <p>
        This will be an event available to mainly children with all ages included. It will most likely be held at a church or religious site or maybe even a sort of charity wanting to spread the joy of Halloween and giving out treats. At this event we will have kids in costume going around to different cars asking for candy from the owners. Like trick-or-treating but in a safe area where they can not travel far from their parents.
