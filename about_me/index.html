    <h2>Cody Smith</h2>
    <p>I am Cody Smith from sin city Las Vegas, NV. I already have an associates degree but needed to further my work force knowledge and found myself applying for BYU-I through Pathways. I currently work at a Postnet as a Graphic Designer which is good for now but am hoping to improve my standings in this world.</p>
    <p>The reason I am pursuing a degree in web design is because I have always loved computers and the many applications you can create out of nothing. It is just so facinating how we are in the Technological Era where hundreds of millions of apps are being created every day.</p>
